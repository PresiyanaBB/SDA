1. In recusrion funcs draw the call tree
2. Two for loops outside one another means O(n+m)
3. Two for loops inside one another means O(n*m)
4. Func calling other func is like replacing with its complexity
5. Cutting half the options each time means O(logn) //or cutting in more than half
6. Vector.erase() - O(n)
7. Vector.push_back() - O(1)
