1. faster cin operation
`std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
std::cin.tie(nullptr);`

2. stable_sort(arr,arr+size,predicate);
```//predicate example for func
//predicate must be bool function that receives 2 of the elements of the array and returns true if first is less than second
bool pred(int a, int b)
{
    if( a < b )
        return true;
    return false;
}```

3. epsilon has more than 6 7 zeroes after the . -> epsilon = 0.00000001

4. use only '\n' and not endl

5. static arrays are better for this course -> int arr[10]{} is better than int* arr = new int[n]{}

6. check if number is even
   !(num & 1)  is better than  !(num % 2)   // both say it is even
